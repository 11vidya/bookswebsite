          <p>
            Artificial intelligence is a constellation of many different
            technologies working together to enable machines to sense,
            comprehend, act, and learn with human-like levels of intelligence.
            Maybe that's why it seems as though everyone's definition of
            artificial intelligence is different: AI isn't just one thing.

          <h1>This is about Screat Book</h1>
          <p>
            The Secret is a 2006 self-help book by Rhonda Byrne, based on the
            earlier film of the same name. It is based on the belief of the
            pseudoscientific law of attraction, which claims that thought alone
            can influence objective circumstances within one's life. The book
            alleges energy as assurance of its effectiveness.
